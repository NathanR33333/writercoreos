# WriterCoreOS

WriterCoreOS is a structured story development system designed to help creators organize characters, worlds, and plot logic in a clean, scalable way.

Many writers and game designers struggle to keep story elements organized as projects grow.
WriterCoreOS aims to provide a structured, system-driven approach to story creation.

- Character profiles with traits, goals, and relationships
- Worldbuilding modules for factions, locations, and lore
- Plot and timeline organization
- Scalable structure for future expansion

Planned Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend (future): Java or Python
- Storage: Local storage / database (TBD)

Status:
Currently in the planning and design phase. Core structure and features are defined and ready for implementation.

This project was created to combine my interest in storytelling, game design, and software development while building a practical system-focused application.
